1. Find the minimal range of files for defragmentation.
	1-1. Profiling read requests --> trace.sh
	1-2. Merge the ranges of read requests --> post-processing.py and merge.py
	1-3. Clarify hot area of the ranges
2. Defragment the minimal range.





Ongoing tasks
1. With range file, perform defragmentation and test it.
2. Hot area define (maybe includes sorting again)


Questions.

1. Which one is better? (Solved)
x 1) Just tracing the read requests and defragment its range one by one.
	 Problems: 	1. I have to implement a new fragmentation profiling tool for
mapping info of each logical offset and physical address.
				2. The later requests can ruin the previous defragmentaiton.
For example, the first request and the second request are overlapped. In this
case, defragmentaiton for the second request can fragment the blocks of the
first reqeust

v 2) Profiling all the requests and define the final range of defragmentation.
	Problems: 	1. How to define hotness
			2. Maybe wider range of defragmentation
